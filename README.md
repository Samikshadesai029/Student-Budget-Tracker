## 🛠️ Tech Used
* *Language:* C++
* *Logic:* Control Structures, File I/O, and Data Validation.

## 📈 Engineering Reflection
I built this to bridge the gap between my Business Analysis course and my C++ Bootcamp. 
The main challenge was ensuring data remained consistent when saving to external files.
